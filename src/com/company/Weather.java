Prompt user for number of days
    Print "How many day's temperatures?"
define int days as answer
Create user control while loop for when it doesn't satisfy
redefine days as answer
create new array weather to store daily temps
initialize variable sum as 0
initialize variable average as 0
initialize variable counter as 0
Create random randy bounded from 25 to 110 inclusive
Create for loop controlled by days and initialize i as 0

    sum = sum + randy

Println average temp = average
create a for loop for the number of days that are greater than the average
Create for loop controlled by days and initialize i as 0
initialize count
then use an if statement to say weather array> average
do count = count + i
Println counter days were above averageâ€©
